Tool to make printable books from Are.na Channels. A modification of Evan Brooks' Bindery.js tool to print websites. Collaboration with Clement Valla.

[Are.na Channel](https://www.are.na/clement-valla/print-are-na-with-bindery-js) | [Github Repository](https://github.com/clementvalla/Are.na_Bindery.js)

The Print Are.na tool wraps stripped-down html with new wrappers. The included css file then styles the manipulated html for an easy, customizable, and print-friendly layout.
